##### Performance optimization results:
Before any optimizations, page load time was 1.69s, 73.9kB was transfered over the network, 199 MB of resources were loaded by the page.
After all optimizations specified in the instructions were performed, page load time was 1.09s, 12.1kB was transfered over the networ and 1.9MB of resources were loaded by the page.
style.css file size did not change after minifying. It's size is 1 KB. This is likely due to the fact that styles.css file was quite small to begin with.
JavaScript file size decreased from 2KB to 1KB after minifying. This, along with moving javascript tags in html to the bottom of the body was the reason the performance has improved.
