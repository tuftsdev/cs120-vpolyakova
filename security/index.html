        <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
        <p>The product being evaluated is a web server for a ride-hailing service. The goal of the assessment is to identify security and privacy issues 
            in the application, so that the customer can correct vulnerabilities and prevent cybersecurity attacks in the future.</p>

        <h1><strong>Methodology</strong></h1>
        <p>Both "black box" and "white box" testing of the web server was performed. Curl was used as a testing tool to send potentially vulnerable post 
            and get statements and a web browser was used to determine if a hacking attack was successful. No programs or additional tools were used for 
            this assignment.</p>
        <p>For "black box" testing, curl was used to populate vehicle info and driver info tables in the post route with random data. Curl was also used 
            to perform a cross site scripting attack to pass malicious data to the server inside script tags. </p>
        <p>For "white box" testing, the code was first examined for vulnerabilities. Then, chrome browser was used to test out the two routes suspected to 
            be vulnerable to SQL injection</p>
        
        <h1><strong>Abstract of Findings</strong></h1>
        <p>The /rides post route was found vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks. The get routes for adding vehicle and customer data to the database 
            were found vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
        <p>The /rides post routes was supposed to return a json list of cars if a username and coordinates were provided by the user. However, since the 
            username data provided by the user was not sanitized in any way, the /rides route became an easy target for malicious hacking attacks. It was 
            possible to pass illegal parameters such as very long strings and special characters as usernames for customers and vehicles without any issues.
            Additionally, a cross site scripting attack was performed by pasting alert("hacked") inside the script tags instead of a valid username.</p>
        <p>The parameters on the get routes (everything after ?) were not sanitized either. The user entries on the server side were concatenated directly 
            into the SQL statement select, from, where. The "where" clause is notoriously vulnerable to SQL injection because an attacker can easily extend 
            it to include other logic and other sql commands. For example, select * from customer_info where username='valentina' can be modified to select 
            * from customer_info where username='valentina' OR '1'='1'. The second part of the OR, 1=1, is always true, hence the select statement will 
            return not just the entries where username is valentina, but everything from the customer_info table, even if valentina is not a valid user.</p>
        
        <h1><strong>Discovered Vulnerabilities</strong></h1>
        <h3><strong>Issue 1: .post /rides route: cross site scripting</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Issue:</u> Cross Site Scripting</li> 
            <li><u>Location / page where issue was found:</u> https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides</li>
            <li><u>Severity:</u> High. /rides route user input is not sanitized, making the server vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks. In 
                cross site scripting, the attacker can execute any java script code inside the script tags, making it easy to steal cookies, re-direct to a 
                different web-site and/or display malicious messages to the user</li>
            <li><u>Description of issue. How did you find it?</u> The issue was identified during "white box" testing of the .post /rides route using curl. 
                After realizing that the usernames are not checked against a list of valid values, other special characters and script tags with various 
                messages were tested and inserted into the database without issues. The server accepted all inputs and the prompts inside script tags were 
                executed on page load as pop-up messages.</li>
            <li><u>Proof of vulnerability.</u>
                <p>Executed curl command:</p><p><a><img src = "issue1_1.png" alt="curl command" "></a></p>
                <p>Proof of vulnerability on the server side:</p><p><a><img src = "issue1_2.png" alt="server screenshot with alert prompt"></a></p>                
                <p><a><img src = "issue1_3.png" alt="server screenshot home page"></a></p>
            </li>
            <li><u>Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved:</u> To resolve the issue, the web server can limit the username field to 
                only accept valid entries that are verified by the server. For example, the server can check the value of the username against a stored 
                array of valid users by executing the following code inside the post route:<br>
            <br>
            <code>var validUser=false;<br>
            var validUsers = ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']; // array of valid usernames<br>
            <br>
            if (!validUsers.includes(req.body.username)) { // check if the provided username is valid <br>
                <a style="margin-left: 25px;"> return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid username' }); // return an error message if the username is invalid</a><br>
            }<br>
            // proceed with processing the request if the username is valid<br></code>
            <br>            
            By implementing this solution, the web server can prevent unauthorized access and protect against cross-site scripting attacks. Additionally, the 
            server should implement input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data. Regular security audits and testing can also help to identify 
            and mitigate vulnerabilities in the web server.</li>            
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Issue 2: .get /passenger.json route:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Issue:</u> SQL Injection</li> 
            <li><u>Location / page where issue was found:</u>https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/passenger.json</li>
            <li><u>Severity:</u>High. Database is compromised. Any data, including username and password information can be retrieved using SQL injection.</li>
            <li><u>Description of issue. How did you find it?</u> The issue was discovered during "white box" testing. After examining the server code, I was 
                suspecting that the passenger .get route is vulnerable to SQL injection because user input data was concatenated directly into the where clause 
                of the select statement. After some testing, I discovered that user input parameter (everything after the ? on the route) can be modified to 
                perform SQL injection. For example, by entering:<br>
                <br>
                <code>username='valentina' OR '1'='1'</code><br>
                <br>
                I was able to retrieve information about all users from the server. <br>
                The url used for the SQL injection attach was the following:<br>
                <br>
                https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/passenger.json?username=valentina%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271<br>
                <br>
                It evaluated to SQL Statement: <br>
                <br>
                <code>theQuery = "SELECT * FROM passengers WHERE username = '"valentina' OR '1'='1" '";</code><br>
                <br>
                Since the second part of the statement after OR is always true, the query will return all information from the passengers table, even if valentina 
                is not a valid user.<br>
                <br>    
            </li>

            </li>
            <li><u>Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved:</u> <br>

                    <li>Use prepared statements</li>
                    <li>Limit data and privileges that a database has access to => least privilege</li>
                </ul>
            </li>            
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Issue 3: .get /vehicle.json route:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Issue:</u> SQL Injection</li>

                <code>username='JANET' OR '1'='1'</code><br>
                <br>
                I was able to retrieve information about all vehicles from the server. <br>
                The url used for the SQL injection attach was the following:<br>
                <br>
                https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/vehicle.json?username=JANET%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271<br>
                <br>
                It evaluated to SQL Statement: <br>

                <br>
                Since the second part of the statement after OR is always true, the query will return all information from the vehicles table, even if JANET 
                is not a valid vehicle username.<br>

        </ul>

        <h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
        <p>The server was found to be very vulnarable to malicious hacking attacks. Before going into production, the server should implement input validation 
            and sanitization for all user-provided data. No special characters should be allowed, especially single and double quotes, as well as script tags. For 
            SQL statements the recommendation is to switch over to prepared statements instead of direct input concatination into the SQL statement. For the database 
            the recommendation is to limit databased access and privilages only to the information pertaining to a logged-in user.</p>
